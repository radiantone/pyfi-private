- Create 2 processors, connect them with plug and outlet. Proc2 listens on queue for proc1 plug.
- Update proc1 plug name, triggers update for proc2 queue



- Add a processor
- Agent runs worker for processor, clones git
- Start, stop, restart processor
- Run tasks for processor
- Send message to processor queue
- Send message to queue topic - all processors receive it
- Agent worker uses signal callbacks to log status, outcome/errors of task
- Agent worker uses signal callbacks to log queue data metrics (e.g. messages, message size etc)
    - Query with SUM() function will perform reporting on results to avoid read lock bottlenecks
- Stop a processor, send messages, start the processor => processor resumes processing messages
- Removing a processor: cannot remove a processor that is running, must stop first.
