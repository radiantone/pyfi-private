Plugs vs Sockets
-----------------

Sockets have queues associated with them so you can invoke them directly.

However, connecting two sockets together requires a plug, which has its own queue?
It's intuitive that the plug would be its own queue so multiple plugs can have their own QoS etc
but then it requires some kind of queue->queue connection
