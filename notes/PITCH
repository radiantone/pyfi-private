elasticcode

- Embeds qualities of service into the network strata that are seamlessly inherited by the code base
- Manages isolation how and where code runs:
    - Creates containers to inject code into, and runs it there
    - Creates virtualenvironments using the code's dependencies and runs the code in that venv (possibly also inside a container)
- Manages where code runs by scheduling/moving/updating/deleting deployments of workers and concurrency levels
- Can scale out/in on the fly without loss of data
-
