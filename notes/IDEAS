- USE ML to try and learn the equation associated with a data stream
- Given a data stream and numerical point values at different times, create a regression model that can predict the point value, given the data stream.
- Data flows feed into web socket channels that are fronted by dashboards and charts
    - Pyfi Charts is a layer on top of Pyfi that connects securely to the websocket feeds to plot data.
    - Create persistent dashboards with PYFI that connect to data processors in real time


CONTAINERS 

Run agent workers inside lightweight prebuilt python container

SIMULATION 

What is the role/benefit of simulation on top of pyfi?
   e.g. simpy?

A simulation harness can model real world processes in an event driven way that 
can interact with pyfi objects. A simulation is a "type of flow" that specifies environmental classes, properties, etc that interact when the simulation is run.
To create a simulation, drag a simulation object onto the canvas. This is the entrypoint. Additional simulation type objects can be connected to the root simulation object
and their properties can be easily configured. You can create your own simulation classes and drop them onto the canvas.
