SIMULATION 

What is the role/benefit of simulation on top of pyfi?
   e.g. simpy?

A simulation harness can model real world processes in an event driven way that 
can interact with pyfi objects. A simulation is a "type of flow" that specifies environmental classes, properties, etc that interact when the simulation is run.
To create a simulation, drag a simulation object onto the canvas. This is the entrypoint. Additional simulation type objects can be connected to the root simulation object
and their properties can be easily configured. You can create your own simulation classes and drop them onto the canvas.
