Working with Flows
------------------

- Creating and editing flows is done offline. Changes are made in the UI to the flow.
    The flow can be saved, loaded and edited multiple times. When the flow is Published to the database,
    the backend will create all the changes required by the flow inside a single transaction that either succeeds or fails.
    For example, if the flow violates any constraints.

    The UI is made aware of the status of the flow publish and if the transaction failed, why it failed.
    
    Then, all the agents participating in the networks affected by the changes will respond. Those status'
    can also be viewed from the UI to see how complete the Flow "deployment" is.
