- Templates uses mixins to add specific types of Processor behaviors to itself
- Processor objects implement various interfaces for dealing with events and messages
- Templates render Processor objects as a view
- Messages arrive over socket.io (via designer canvas) and affect vuex data which triggers events in various template views
    - For example, modification to processor id 1234 arrives over socket. Canvas will update vuex with new state, any existing
    template views with that processor will automatically react/refresh
