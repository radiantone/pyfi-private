11. SQLAlchemy data model (e.g. Flow, Processor, Settings, User, Node, Task, Log, Queue, etc) 10%
     This data model is managed by PYFI micro-service, UI and also task callbacks that need to store metadata about the task completion.
     The UI will read from this database to display info
     The CLI will also read from this database
     Celery can use this as a backend as well, allowing for joins across PYFI data tables and celery result tables.
